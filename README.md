# ðŸ¤– InstaUpload
Download image file from URL and upload with custom caption profiles to instagram bot. Been using this on my VPS while botting on instagram, maybe someone will find it useful.

#### Usage:
```
-d <download from url>
-u <upload file>
-p <profile>
-c <cred for upload>

 Usage:
    python insta_upload.py -d <url>
    python insta_upload.py -u -p art -c NameCredit
    python insta_upload.py -u -p nature -c NameCredit
```

#### Known issues:
```
* only JPG support
* cannot download image from instagram URLs
* this -c command only accepts one-liner
```
